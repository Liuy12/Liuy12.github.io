- cole trapnell: 
glm fit to detect single cell trajactory
lineage dependent genes 
single-cell ATAC-seq
TF-idf, tranfrom binary data to continious data

- wenyi Wang
deconvolution of mixed gene expression in hetergenenity of samples (cell-type proportions)
Simply speaking, remvoe the heterogenity noise (normal within tumor), by asssuming a mixture model and bayesian statistics. 






ideas:
real-time meomory visuliztion for R
