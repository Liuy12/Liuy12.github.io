# BioC Day 1

Some nite packages found on developer day Bioc2015

- solr: General purpose R interface to Solr. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/solr/index.html>

- Rabix: to make bioinformatics pipelines. <https://www.rabix.org/>

- covr: Test coverage for packages. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covr/index.html>

- lintr: Statis R code analysis. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/index.html>

- codetools: code analysis tools for R. Default tools used by R CMD check. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codetools/index.html>

- codecov, backend coverage tool for covr. <https://codecov.io/>


# Day2 BioC

- cole trapnell: 
glm fit to detect single cell trajactory
lineage dependent genes 
single-cell ATAC-seq
TF-idf, tranfrom binary data to continious data

- wenyi Wang
deconvolution of mixed gene expression in hetergenenity of samples (cell-type proportions)
Simply speaking, remvoe the heterogenity noise (normal within tumor), by asssuming a mixture model and bayesian statistics. 

- Karl Broman

# Day3 BioC

- Zhijin Wu
Gene set analysis
Global test, TEGS (2013)
(GSA, Efron & Tibshirani 2007) same direction of genes in the pathway. 
take considerations of small but consistant change of all the genes in the gene set 

questions 
- Not same direction in biological pathways
- PCA based method
- simulation vs real data evaluation 
- False positives, AUC during simulation 
- R package?

- Artem Sokolov
Integrating prior biological knowledge using Generalized Elastic Nets
gelnet <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gelnet/index.html>

- TCGA downloader 
mogsa: Multiple omics data integration and gene set analysis <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mogsa.html>

RTCGAToolbox: A new tool for exporting TCGA Firehose data <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/RTCGAToolbox.html>

SGSeq: Splice event detection and quantification from RNA-seq data
<http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SGSeq.html>







ideas:
- Drug-drug interaction (DsigDB, and TCGA data)
- real-time meomory visuliztion for R
- dynamic heatmap, vector-based editing (interactive plot ggvis)
- code executing time estimate (like data.table does, prob some C code)
- different type of errors (family wise type error)
- Bayesian statistiscs summary (refresh basics)
- normalization comparison for RNA-seq, miRNA-seq
- DE analysis comparison of DESeq2, edgeR-robust
- feature selection, iterative ensembel learning 
- update XBSeq,
