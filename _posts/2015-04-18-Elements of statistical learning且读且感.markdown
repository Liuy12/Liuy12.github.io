liner regression
----------------

$$ RSS(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(y^i - {x_i^T}\beta\right)^2 $$

Model itself rely heavily on the assumption that a linear boundary is appropriate. It has low variance and potentially high bias. 

K nearest neighbors
-------------------

Non-linear boundary. Do not depend on the underlying structure of the data and tend to have high variance and low bias.
